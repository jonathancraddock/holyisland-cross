## Features

The app began as a simple form that accepted safe crossing times which you previously had to copy and paste from the Northumberland Council website. As my focus was to simplify the calculation of Pilgrim's Way crossing times over Holy Island Sands, I've now simplified it by pre-calculating the times and presenting it as a date picker. After that, I also added a search filter.

* Date picker - shows crossing times
* Navigation buttons to step through dates
* Display a sun icon (daylight) or moon icon (night)
* Show a dalight table for this latitude (dawn, sunrise, solar noon, etc)
* Created a filter option (search for crossing that meet your criteria)

*Interesting to note that the Admiralty low-tide typically shows as approx 25-30 mins before the "midpoint" as calculated from the causeway safe-crossing times.*

*In summary, cross on a receeding tide. Journey takes approximately 90 minutes. Start time should be calculated by subtracting 90-120 minutes from the **mid-point** of the safe (traffic) crossing times.*
